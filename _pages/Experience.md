**Blog on our experience at N@TM!**
Overall, it was great being able to see our peers different applications and being able to interact with them. Some of our favorite projects were the chess and minesweeper games that we interacted with. In addition, talking with the brothers, sisters, and parents of our peers was also a great experience because it allowed us to see the different perspectives of a diverse group of people. Many people asked great questions about our project and we are grateful for that. The most frequest question was how we were able to fetch the recipes. In addition, talking with the CSA students was also inspiring because all of their applications were really advanced and interactive. It helped us grasp an idea of what CSA kids are doing and how it compares to us CSP students. Overall, we had a great time, and we look forward to going to N@TM again!
