    <p><strong>Sri:</strong> 10/26</p>
<ul>
  <li>So far, what I did was I coded the game Snake. First I did it in python, not knowing that it would open in a terminal and I would not be able to put it on my website. So after that I deleted it and I worked on it using Javascript, because it could be put on a website, or so I was told. After I finished that, I changed my part of the Flask but I wasn’t able to put the actual game on there and as it turns out that we have to use fastpages for the frontend, and I am pretty sure I am done with the backend part as well the Devops part, so all I have to work on is the frontend.</li>
</ul>

  <li>I was off to a pretty rough start when I couldn’t properly commit and sync ANY changes to our group fastpages and flask. However, with the help from access tokens, I was finally able to start coding. As the backend developer, I am working mainly on our Flask repo. Like Sri, I also started off with python, but then realized that it would not display on the website. As a result, I started working using JavaScript in order to work behind the scenes in order to create my game.</li>
</ul>

  <li>As the scrum master of loophole games, I partook in mainly planning the project and working on my group assignment, which is creating a pong game in the frontend. In terms of developing, our group is a little behind schedul. However, with everything sorted out today, we now have a clear plan of attack and now know our exact roles in terms of backend and frontend work. For the pong game, I have written a working code for the game in javascript, and I am now transferring that work into a fast pages (frontend). We are mainly planning to finish our game by this weekend, and start on the jokes/api to transfer data from frontend to backend for the leaderboard that will appear on our flask page.</li>

  <li>Over the weekend, I was able to implement our API into our new food app. Like Mortenson mentioned in class, I was also tried to implement my JavaScript, and the html and css into one consecutive file. Even though we shifted from a game website to a food recipe app, we have made more progress than we ever had with the food idea.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Alyssa:</strong> 11/1</p>

  <li>So far, I was able to develop the html and css elements to make our food recipe app visually appealing to the viewer.</li>

  <li>After Nathan finished with the Css and Html, I deployed whatever he did onto our actual website. First I pulled it and made sure that it was in my vscode and then I deployed using AWS to makes sure that are website had that too for everyone to see and not just me.</li>
