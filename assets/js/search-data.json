          "content": "Sri: 10/26 . So far, what I did was I coded the game Snake. First I did it in python, not knowing that it would open in a terminal and I would not be able to put it on my website. So after that I deleted it and I worked on it using Javascript, because it could be put on a website, or so I was told. After I finished that, I changed my part of the Flask but I wasn’t able to put the actual game on there and as it turns out that we have to use fastpages for the frontend, and I am pretty sure I am done with the backend part as well the Devops part, so all I have to work on is the frontend. | . Nathan Kim: 10/27 . I was off to a pretty rough start when I couldn’t properly commit and sync ANY changes to our group fastpages and flask. However, with the help from access tokens, I was finally able to start coding. As the backend developer, I am working mainly on our Flask repo. Like Sri, I also started off with python, but then realized that it would not display on the website. As a result, I started working using JavaScript in order to work behind the scenes in order to create my game. | . Max Wu: 10/27 . As the scrum master of loophole games, I partook in mainly planning the project and working on my group assignment, which is creating a pong game in the frontend. In terms of developing, our group is a little behind schedul. However, with everything sorted out today, we now have a clear plan of attack and now know our exact roles in terms of backend and frontend work. For the pong game, I have written a working code for the game in javascript, and I am now transferring that work into a fast pages (frontend). We are mainly planning to finish our game by this weekend, and start on the jokes/api to transfer data from frontend to backend for the leaderboard that will appear on our flask page. | . Nathan Kim: 11/1 . Over the weekend, I was able to implement our API into our new food app. Like Mortenson mentioned in class, I was also tried to implement my JavaScript, and the html and css into one consecutive file. Even though we shifted from a game website to a food recipe app, we have made more progress than we ever had with the food idea. | . Alyssa: 11/1 . So far, I was able to develop the html and css elements to make our food recipe app visually appealing to the viewer. | . Max Wu: 11/1 .

Even though we shifted from a game website to a food recipe app, we have made more progress than we ever had with the food idea. | . Sri: 11/2 . After Nathan finished with the Css and Html, I deployed whatever he did onto our actual website. First I pulled it and made sure that it was in my vscode and then I deployed using AWS to makes sure that are website had that too for everyone to see and not just me. | .",

We enjoyed talking to our peers about their projects too. Our favorite projects from other groups was a minesweeper and chess game because they were extremely well made and interactive for the users to play. We also enjoyed talking to our peer’s parents because they asked many questions about our project. We thought our most popular question asked was how we were able to fetch the different recipes in our website. In addition, talking with the CSA kids in the other room was also nice because we got to see how CSA operates their websites (many of them were really good). In conclusion, we had lots of fun at N@tm and we are excited to attend more in the future! .",
